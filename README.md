GymBuddy\n
Luke Ponssen, Ethan Nguyen, Jonathan Preiss\n
Our application will help gym goers track their workout plans, weightlifting goals, and meal plans. This will help them stay motivated and disciplined while also providing them with insight on their past gym history and giving them resources to optimize their schedule for their specific goals. One resource can include links to YouTube videos on how to properly do an exercise. This will be implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will also use PHP for backend scripting. 
For the major muscle groups, we will have a list of 2 exercises for beginners and 2 for advanced gym goers (ie. biceps, triceps, shoulders, forearms, calves, hamstrings, lower back, upper back, lower, middle, upper core, etc.)
We will possibly have a calculation based off of what their max weight is for each muscle group of where to focus their next workout/attention on.
